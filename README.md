# MealPlanningGuru
BSIT Capstone Project

Our team is tasked with the development of an application designed to help users
schedule meals throughout the week. Basic functionalities of the app include:
adding recipes from an external site to the userâ€™s calendar, allow the user to
customize the recipe book associated with their account by importing/ exporting
recipes, and allow users to transfer their current grocery list to an external grocery
store site.
